    "1. Welcome Message:\n",
    "- The program starts by greeting, setting the stage for the ATM simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize Account Balance:\n",
    "- The balance variable is set to 1000, representing the user's starting account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set Up and Verify PIN:\n",
    "- The user_pin variable holds the correct PIN ('1234').\n",
    "- The user is prompted to enter their PIN.\n",
    "- The entered PIN is compared to user_pin.\n",
    "- If the PIN is incorrect, the program notifies and sets atm_on to False to prevent entering the main loop.\n",
    "- If the PIN is correct, atm_on is set to True, allowing access to the ATM functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Main ATM Operation Loop:\n",
    "- A while loop is used, controlled by the atm_on flag.\n",
    "- Inside the loop, the main menu is displayed with options to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. User Choice Handling:\n",
    "- The user's choice is captured through input.\n",
    "- if-elif-else statements handle the different choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Balance Inquiry:\n",
    "- If the user chooses to check the balance, it's displayed using the balance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives :\n",
    "7. Deposit Money:\n",
    "- The user can deposit money, which is added to balance.\n",
    "- The deposit amount and updated balance are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Withdraw Money:\n",
    "- For withdrawals, the program checks if the balance is sufficient .\n",
    "- If so, the requested amount is subtracted from balance, and the withdrawal is confirmed.\n",
    "- If the balance is insufficient, a warning message is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Exiting the Program:\n",
    "- The user can choose to exit the ATM.\n",
    "- On exiting, a goodbye message is shown, and atm_on is set to False, ending the loop and the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Invalid Choice Handling:\n",
    "- If the user enters an option that's not on the menu, the program prompts them to try again."
